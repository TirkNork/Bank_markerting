# Bank Marketing Campaigns Analysis


The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution
in order to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. Python will be utilized for tasks including visualization,
feature engineering, preprocessing, and applying predictive models such as Logistic Regression. Additionally, techniques for handling
imbalanced datasets, such as SMOTE, will be employed, and hyperparameter tuning will be conducted using GridSearchCV.
